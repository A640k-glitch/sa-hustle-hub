## The Hustle

South Africa's food and grocery delivery market exploded and it's still growing. 
**Uber Eats** and **Checkers Sixty60** both need delivery partners — and they're actively recruiting.

## What You Earn

| Platform | Pay Structure | Payout |
|---|---|---|
| Uber Eats | Per delivery + tips | Weekly |
| Checkers Sixty60 | Per order + bonuses | Weekly |

Drivers typically earn **R5,000–R12,000/month** depending on hours worked and location.

## What You Need

- A bicycle, motorbike, or car (even a bicycle works in Sixty60 dense areas).
- A valid South African ID.
- A smartphone with data.
- Submit documents via the app or website.

## Load-Shedding Tip 🕯️

Schedule your delivery hours **outside** load-shedding slots when restaurant kitchens are operating. Check your local schedule the night before.

## Honest Assessment

**Good for:** People with transport who want consistent, predictable earnings.  
**Not for:** Those without a vehicle in rural areas.
