## The Hustle

Facebook Marketplace is the biggest free classifieds platform in South Africa. 
Millions of South Africans browse it daily. There are zero listing fees and no middleman.

You can sell:
- **Clothes** you no longer wear
- **Handmade crafts** (candles, crocheted items, beaded jewelry)
- **Secondhand furniture, electronics, or appliances**
- **Home-cooked food** (in your community — check local regulations)

## What You Earn

Completely depends on what you sell, but R500–R5,000/month is achievable for consistent sellers. 
Start with what you already own.

## How to Start (Zero Cost)

1. Open the **Facebook app** → tap **Marketplace**.
2. Tap **+ Create new listing**.
3. Add clear photos (natural light works best), a fair price, and a description.
4. Reply to messages quickly — speed closes sales.
5. Meet buyers in public places or use cash / SnapScan for payment safety.

## Payment Safety

- Use **SnapScan** or **Zapper** for contactless payments.
- Or open a free **TymeBank** account for instant EFT — no monthly fees.
- Never release goods before payment is confirmed.

## Load-Shedding Tip 🕯️

Take your listing photos and write descriptions during power-on windows. 
Schedule your "reply" hours around load-shedding blocks.

## Honest Assessment

**Good for:** Anyone with items to sell, crafters, or people who can source cheap goods to flip.  
**Not for:** Those who need instant income — sales can take days.
