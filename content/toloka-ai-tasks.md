## What is Toloka?

Toloka is a global platform where artificial intelligence companies pay ordinary people to label data — 
things like identifying objects in photos, checking search results, or rating translations.

It sounds technical but the tasks are designed to be simple. If you can read and follow 
basic instructions, you can do it.

## What You Earn

- **R50–R300/day** depending on how many tasks are available and how fast you work.
- Payments via **PayPal** — you can convert to Rands using PayPal's ZAR withdrawal or a forex card.
- More tasks available during global business hours (US/EU mornings = SA afternoons/evenings).

## What You Need

- Any smartphone or laptop with internet.
- A PayPal account (free to create).
- Read the task instructions carefully — accuracy affects your access to better-paying tasks.

## Pro Tips

- **Start early**: New tasks are often posted in the morning. First-come, first-served.
- **Accuracy > Speed**: Getting tasks right unlocks higher-paying batches.
- **Diversify**: Combine Toloka with SagaPoll for a "survey stack" strategy.

## Load-Shedding Tip 🕯️

Toloka tasks work on mobile data and are quick (30 seconds to 5 minutes each). 
Download the app on WIFI and do tasks during load-shedding using a power bank.

## Honest Assessment

**Good for:** Anyone with a smartphone wanting flexible, quiet micro-income.  
**Not for:** Those without a PayPal account or access to moderate internet.
