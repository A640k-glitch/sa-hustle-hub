## What is SagaPoll?

SagaPoll is an African-built platform that pays you to complete short surveys about your lifestyle, shopping habits, and opinions. 
Unlike international survey sites, SagaPoll is designed *for* South Africans — so the questions actually make sense.

## What You Earn

- **Cash or Airtime** deposited directly to your phone.
- Surveys take **5–15 minutes** and pay between **R5 – R50** each.
- Minimum payout is low, so you won't wait months to withdraw.

## What You Need

- A smartphone (any budget Android).
- A mobile number and basic internet access.
- Nothing else — zero upfront cost.

## Load-Shedding Tip 🕯️

Download the app and pre-load surveys on your lunch break or at a WIFI hotspot. Complete them offline or during low-traffic hours to save data.

## Honest Assessment

**Good for:** Anyone wanting quick extra airtime money.  
**Not for:** Full-time income. Think R200–R600/month in your spare time.
