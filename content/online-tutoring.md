## The Hustle

If you know something someone else wants to learn — maths, English, coding, music — you can charge for it. 
Platforms like **Superprof** and **Teach Me 2** connect you with paying students instantly, no classroom needed.

## What You Earn

- **R100–R450 per hour** depending on subject and your experience.
- Maths, Science, and English are always in high demand.
- Online lessons via WhatsApp Video or Google Meet cost you zero.

## What You Need

- Knowledge of any subject (matric level is enough to start).
- A phone or laptop with a camera.
- A profile on Superprof or Teach Me 2 (free to create).

## Getting Started

1. Go to [Superprof](https://www.superprof.co.za) and create a free tutor profile.
2. List your subject, experience, and hourly rate.
3. Students contact you directly to book lessons.

## Load-Shedding Tip 🕯️

Use **WhatsApp Audio** if video drops. Pre-send PDF worksheets so students can work during outages.
