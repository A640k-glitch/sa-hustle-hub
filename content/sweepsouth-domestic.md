## What You Earn

- Average **R120–R200 per half-day session**.
- Payments go directly to your bank account weekly.
- The more sessions you complete, the higher your rating and earning potential.

## What You Need

- A valid South African ID or work permit.
- A smartphone to manage bookings through the app.
- A good attitude — your rating is your reputation.

2. Fill in the application form (takes 10 minutes).
3. Attend a quick vetting session.
4. Start booking sessions in your area.

## Load-Shedding Tip 🕯️

Schedule your bookings during Stage 1-2 load-shedding times when transport is still running reliably. 
Check the Eskom or EskomSePush schedule the night before.

## Honest Assessment

**Good for:** Anyone comfortable with domestic work who wants reliable, weekly income.  
**Not for:** People without local transport to reach clients.
